In addition to using aggregate functions, you can perform basic arithmetic with symbols like +, -, *, and /
SQL assumes that if you divide an integer by an integer, you want to get an integer back. So be careful when dividing! So when you're dividing make sure at least one of your numbers has a decimal place.
SQL allows you to do something called aliasing. Aliasing simply means you assign a temporary name to something. To alias, you use the AS keyword. 
ORDER BY keyword is used to sort results in ascending or descending order according to the values of one or more columns. (DESC or ASC). DESC gives you reverse order. ORDER BY can also be used to sort on multiple columns. It will sort by the first column specified, then sort by the next, then the next, and so on
GROUP BY is used with aggregate functions like COUNT() or MAX(). Note that GROUP BY always goes after the FROM clause! Note also that ORDER BY always goes after GROUP BY
Aggregate functions can't be used in WHERE clauses.
